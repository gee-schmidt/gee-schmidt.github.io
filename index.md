Welcome to my personal website! My name is Greta, I’m a PhD student in the [Joint Doctoral Program in Ecology] (https://biology.sdsu.edu/eco/prog_phd.php) at [San Diego State University](https://biology.sdsu.edu/) and [UC Davis](https://ecology.ucdavis.edu/).

At SDSU I’m a member of the [Conservation Ecology Lab](conservationecologylab.com) and during the year I spent at UC Davis I was a visiting researcher in the [Smith Ecology Lab](https://smithlab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/). 

My PhD research is focused on long-term spatial and temporal patterns in wildlife community dynamics in the Sonoran Desert Region, in particular to support Sonoran pronghorn recovery and reintroduction. 

Prior to this work I completed my MS research in the Conservation Ecology Lab on the spatial ecology of ocelots and bobcats in south Texas in the context of roads and underpasses to inform mitigation efforts.

It is important to me that my research unites ecological theory with conservation applications, and I’m especially driven to explore variation in wildlife space use, abundance, and distribution across landscapes, with an eye to the effects of human-mediated change.

Please get in touch if you'd like to hear more about my work, or have questions about the Conservation Ecology Lab/ SDSU Ecology Master's program/ SDSU-UCD Joint Doc Program in Ecology. Happy to discuss!
